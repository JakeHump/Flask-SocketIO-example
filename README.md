This is a fork of the excellent examples provided by Miguel Grinberg in his Github repository at https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO/tree/master/example. I wanted to do 3 things with this fork: (1) simplify the number of examples/amount of information being output to the page, (2) add debugging messages on both the Python server side and the JavaScript client side so developers can get a better look at the client-server communications taking place, and (3) rewrite any jQuery into vanilla JavaScript in order to remove that dependency.
